A skill is a progressive-disclosure document set the agent loads on demand. Only the `name` + `description` are pre-loaded into context; the SKILL.md body is read when the skill triggers, and `references/*.md` files are read one at a time only when needed. Authoring a skill means writing for that loading model — not dumping a manual into context.

- **SKILL.md is a router, not an encyclopedia.** It gives a short overview and points to reference files; depth lives in `references/`.
- **Only add what the model doesn't already know.** Every token competes with the conversation. Skip what an LLM is already confident about.
- **`description` drives discovery.** Write it in third person, stating *what the skill does* and *when to use it*, with concrete trigger terms.
- **Match this repo's house format**, not Anthropic's generic `# heading` layout. Model new skills on the existing `git-commit-convention` skill.
- Skills live in `skills/{skill-name}/` — the `skills/` **subdirectory**, never the repo root (the repo itself is also named `skills`).

> This skill is pure markdown — no scripts or tooling, matching repo convention.
